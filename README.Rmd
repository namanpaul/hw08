**I bet there is no easy way of learning how to build a package. Thanks to @jennybc and her team for putting up the best documentation and step-by-step guide to do this task of package building!**

This package is an extension of the [STAT-547M classwork](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/packages00_index.html).

The functions were developed in class and the last one as homework:

- `fbind()`
- `freq_out()`
- `m3plot()`
